# Jovin.ml
This repository contains the different machine learning and deeplearning projects which i have done with Pytorch . I started to learn about pytorh from Jovin.ml so its name dedicated to them . I am so thankful to their team to provide me free course.

In the tutorial, most of the models were implemented with less than 30 lines of code. Before starting this tutorial, it is recommended to finish [Official Pytorch Tutorial](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html). If you are also interested in generative models, please check our recent work [StarGAN v2](https://github.com/clovaai/stargan-v2).
