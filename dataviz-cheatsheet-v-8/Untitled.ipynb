    "Insurance cost prediction using linear regression\n",
    "In this assignment we're going to use information like a person's age, sex, BMI, no. of children and smoking habit to predict the price of yearly medical bills. This kind of model is useful for insurance companies to determine the yearly insurance premium for a person. The dataset for this problem is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a model with the following steps: 1. Download and explore the dataset 2. Prepare the dataset for training 3. Create a linear regression model 4. Train the model to fit the data 5. Make predictions using the trained model\n",

    "As you go through this notebook, you will find a ??? in certain places. Your job is to replace the ??? with appropriate code or values, to ensure that the notebook runs properly end-to-end . In some cases, you'll be required to choose some hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size etc.). Try to experiment with the hypeparameters to get the lowest loss."
